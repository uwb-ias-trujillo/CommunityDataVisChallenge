# CommunityDataVisChallenge

Instructions for community-engaged data visualization challenges for teaching dashboard design

*Authored by Caleb Trujillo [@calebtru](calebtru.github.com)*

## Expectations for successful community-engaged partnership
1. Pre-class discussions with the instructor to review goals and objectives for student outcomes
2. Completion of a data agreement and finalize data challenge
3. Classroom visitation the second or third week of class or video if not possible.
4. Classroom visitation or feedback on initial drafts of the dashboards in week 7 of the course.
5. Review the final student products and discuss the next iteration or completion with the instructor. 

## Proposals 
Please provide a proposal for the challenge so we can share your ideas with the class. Students work in groups of 2-4 people over the course of 6-7 weeks.
Please include: 
### 1. Basic information
* Title of the challenge
* Your name, title, and organization as the community partner
* Date of challenge 
### 2. A challenge overview 
* A concise statement of the data challenge. 
* Begin the proposal with a section that describes the data dashboard's purpose and clarifies the data visualization challenge. 
* A description of your dashboard challenge's purpose, stakeholders, and intent.
* The challenging task with a list of targeted goals or questions that the visual analytic techniques should address in the dashboard
* An example or sketch of your data interface that meets the challenge or highlights the current design issues.
### 3. Background
* A "data biography” that tells the story of the data as if it had a life—where was it born? What happened to it? What are its relationships like? What context or issues surround it?
* Be sure that the data are anonymized appropriately,
* Data sources must be accessible to anyone in the class, so include a link, file, or instructions.
* Consider links to other resources to find details or citation information to publications or data sets.
* Do metadata or data dictionaries accompany the data?

### 4. Details of the challenge for each objective or task
* The main idea here is to give enough details so that teams can create a goal-oriented dashboard. 
* Identify a purpose you hope the data visual can achieve. Some dashboards might provide information or analysis, while others are more exploratory and user-driven. 
* Explain the motivation for publishing the visual
* Provide an initial idea, so students have a place to start. 
* If this is an initial data display, I recommend you start small by focusing on two or three basic objectives that accomplish specific tasks with the existing data.
* In addition to some basic objectives, consider ambitious, difficult objectives for the students who like an added challenge to represent their skills.
* Describe the potential users or stakeholders who may be using this dashboard. 
* Additionally, make clear what the intent of your dashboard is. 


Be clear about the questions, tasks, and designs you want teams to address. 

To identify a clear intent, consider some of the following questions:
* Why does this challenge matter?
* What do we hope to learn? Is there a claim you hope to investigate?
* Are there trends you want to test or show?
* Are you letting the data speak for itself?
* Do you want teams to come up with various interpretations or one?

Some design considerations, if known, will also help: 
- Data: Do you want them to show more data with lots of details or less data with key information?
- Structure: Do you want the user to see individual pages, related pages, or fully open dashboards?
- Visual representations: Would you prefer more detailed visuals like lists, tables, and charts or simplified visuals like symbols, trends, and summary values?
- Interactions: Would you like users to have interactive tools that help them explore, navigate, focus, and/or filter the data?
- Color: Is there a particular color or consideration you would like the design to have
