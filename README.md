# CommunityDataVisChallenge

Instuctions for community-engaged data visualization challenges for teaching dashboard design
By Caleb Trujillo @calebtru


## Expectations for successful community-engaged partnership
1. Pre-class discussions with instructor to review goals and objective for student outcomes
2. Completion of a data agreement and finalize data challenge
3. Classroom visitation the second or third week of class or video if not possible.
4. Classroom visitation or feedback on initial drafts of the dashboards week 7 of the course.
5. Review of the final student products and discussions with instructor regarding next iteration or completion. 

## Proposals 
In order to share our ideas with the class please provide a proposal of the challenge. Student’s work in groups of 2-4 people over the course 6-7 weeks.
Please include: 
### 1. Basic information
* Title of the challenge
* Your name, title and organization as the community partner
* Date of challenge 
### 2. A challenge overview 
* A succinct statement of the data challenge. 
* Begin the proposal with a section that describes what the data visualizations will be all about. Clarify what the data challenge is. 
* A description of the purpose, the stakeholders, and the intent of your dashboard challenge.
* The challenging task with a list of targeted goals or questions that the visual analytic techniques should address in the dashboard
* An example or sketch of your data interface that meets the challenge or highlights the current design issues.
### 3. Background
* A "data biography” that tells the story of the data as if it had a life—where was it born? What happened to it? What are its relationships like? What context or issues surround it?
* Be sure that the data are anonymized appropriately,
* Data sources need to be accessible for anyone in the class so include a link, file, or instructions to access it.
* Consider links to other resources to find details or citation information to publications or data sets.
* Are there metadata or data dictionaries that accompany the data?

### 4. Details of the challenge for each objective or task
* The main idea here is to give enough details so that teams can create a goal-oriented dashboard. 
* Identify a purpose you hope the data visual can achieve. Some dashboards might be providing information or analysis while others are more exploratory and user-driven. 
* Explain the motivation for publishing the visual
* Provide an initial idea so students have a place to start. 
* If this is an initial data display, I recommend you start small by focusing on two or three basic objectives that accomplish specific tasks with the existing data.
* In addition to some basic objectives, consider ambitious, difficult objectives for the students who like an added challenge to represent their skills.
* Describe who the potential users or stakeholders are that may be using this dashboard. 
* Additionally, make clear what the intent of your dashboard is. 


Be clear about the questions, tasks, and designs you want teams to address. 

To identify a clear intent consider some of the following questions:
* Why does this challenge matter?
* What do we hope to learn? Is there a claim you hope to investigate?
* Are there trends you want to test or show?
* Are you letting the data speak for itself?
* Do you want teams to come up with a variety of interpretations or one?

Some design considerations, if known, will also help: 
- Data: Do you want them to show more data with lots of details or less data with key information?
- Structure: Do you want the user to see individual pages, related pages, or fully open dashboards?
- Visual representations: Would you prefer more detailed visuals like lists, tables and charts, or simplified visuals like symbols, trends, and summary values?
- Interactions: Would you like users to have interactive tools that help them explore, navigate, focus and/or filter the data?
- Color: Is there a particular color or consideration you would like the design to have
